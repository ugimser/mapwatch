Welcome to MapWatch PoE!

This page is designed to present the logs from your Path of Exile 1 and Path of Exile 2 gameplay in an accessible and graphical way. Once you load the Client.txt log file, you will receive detailed summaries and visualizations that help you analyze the progress of your most recent session or simply satisfy your curiosity about the statistics and events from days, weeks, or months of gameplay.

To get started:

Click the Select Client.txt button.

Select logs\Client.txt from your game folder, probably:
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt
- C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt

Press the Start thinking button.

The waiting time depends on the file size, but should not be longer than a few dozen seconds. Once done, enjoy your game analysis!
