## Welcome to MapWatch PoE!

This page is designed to present the logs from your **Path of Exile 1** and **Path of Exile 2** gameplay in an accessible and graphical way. Once you load the `Client.txt` log file, you will receive detailed summaries and visualizations that help you analyze the progress of your most recent session or simply satisfy your curiosity about the statistics and events from days, weeks, or months of gameplay.

### To get started:

1. Click the **Select Client.txt** button.
2. Select `logs\Client.txt` from your game folder, probably:
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt`
   - `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Path of Exile\logs\Client.txt`
3. Press the **Start thinking** button.

The waiting time depends on the file size, but should not be longer than a few dozen seconds. Once done, enjoy your game analysis!

### Thanks to Erosson – the creator of the original Mapwatch

I’d like to thank [erosson](https://mapwatch.erosson.org) for creating **mapwatch.erosson.org** – for a long time, it was the only place where you could track *Path of Exile* map stats online. I used the site for years and truly missed it after it went offline.

Although I never had any contact with the author, his work inspired me to create my own version — a continuation based on a similar idea, but built entirely from scratch. I didn’t copy any code or solutions, but without erosson, I probably would’ve never started this project.

**Thanks for the amazing work — it truly made a difference.**  
I hope this version will be at least partially as useful as the original.
